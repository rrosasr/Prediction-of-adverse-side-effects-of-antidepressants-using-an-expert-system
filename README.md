In this work, an expert system is proposed to predict the risk of adverse side effects in individual patients under the medication of antidepressant. The system predicts the risk of seven adverse drug reactions (serotonin syndrome, nausea, suicidal ideation, somnolence, gastrointestinal symptoms, sexual defunctions and hepatobiliary symptoms) based on physiological information from patients, specifically, sex, age and pharmaceutical aspects such as type of antidepressant in use, and concurrent medication. The system utilizes fuzzy logic to handle the inherent uncertainty and imprecision in the input data, allowing for a more flexible model. By integrating these variables into the predictive framework, the aim is to provide healthcare professionals with valuable insight into the likelihood and severity of adverse reactions in patients. The risk of side effects is categorized into four degrees: none, low, medium, and high, enabling clinicians to tailor treatment plans and monitor patients accordingly.
